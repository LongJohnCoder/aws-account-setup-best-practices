#Prerequisites
#Master Account with Organizations configured
#Support request to increase account limit
#CLI installed with credentials configured

#Create the account
aws organizations create-account --email <valid-email-address> --account-name <unique-descriptive-name>

#Account creation is pretty quick, but you can check on the provisioning this way
aws organizations describe-create-account-status --create-account-request-id <request-id output from previous command>

#Once account is created you can verify metadata as follows
aws organizations describe-account --account-id <account-id output from create-account command>

#When logged into the AWS console on the master account in the Organization you can access the newly created account by assuming a role as follows:
#Click on the 12-digit account ID at the top right of the browser, and select Switch Role
#Use the 12-digit account ID from the create account command
#Use the following name for the IAM Role: OrganizationAccountAccessRole
#And you're in!
